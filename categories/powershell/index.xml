      <description>As an MCITP I&amp;rsquo;m well-versed in Group Policy and what not, but building a clean Windows base image with all updates applied and some prerequisite software has always always been a relatively manual, inconsistent, and annoying process. I recently did a major overhaul of our Operations Network/Server Infrastructure and figured there&amp;rsquo;s no better time to give my trusty Chef, Packer &amp;amp; Vagrant tool set a shot with our workstations.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;ve got my OS X &amp;amp; *nix infrastructure under the control of Chef, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got e2e OS build &amp;amp; deployment processes in place (Packer -&amp;gt; Vagrant -&amp;gt; Chef ).</description>

      <title>AWS - Globally Adjusting ELB SSL Policy</title>

      <description>A while back, I had to adjust the policy of all Elastic Load Balancers in my organization to disable SSLv3 due to the POODLE exploit. This can be an error-prone task if done by hand, especially if your architecture spans multiple regions and/or more than a handful of ELBs. The nice thing about cloud architecture, is that nearly everything can be automated and/or scripted. For that reason, I went ahead and wrote a PowerShell script to handle this.</description>

      <title>Chef &amp; Berkshelf - SSL Certificate Validation Error on Windows</title>
      <link>https://bdwyertech.net/2014/09/12/chef-berkshelf-ssl-certificate-validation-error-on-windows/</link>

      <description>When using Windows, Chef, Vagrant and Berkshelf, you may encounter an issue with certificate validation. The error you may encounter is as follows:
Faraday::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed The problem is Ruby is expecting the SSL_CERT_FILE environmental variable to be set. This should point to a CA bundle to use for SSL certificate validation. If this is not set, certificate validation will fail. You can adjust the Berkshelf configuration to not verify SSL certificates, but I have found this setting to be problematic and sporadically not work.</description>

      <title>How to Empty the Active Directory Recycling Bin</title>

      <description>One of the coolest new features in Server 2008 R2 and 2012 is the ability to recover deleted Active Directory objects. Your forest functional level must be at least 2008 R2 in order to activate this feature. Server 2008 R2 introduced the AD Administrative Center which provides a nice GUI to restore deleted objects after activated. However, eventually one might want to permanently empty the contents of this recycling bin. There is no way to do this via the GUI.</description>
