      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying to renew my CCNP as of recently, and I decided to create a refresher blog post about the implementation of VACLs.
VLAN Access Control Lists (VACLs) can be used to implement Access Control at both Layer 2 and Layer 3. Typically, access lists are applied to ingress or egress traffic on a routed, L3 interface. VACL&amp;rsquo;s allow you to apply the filtering to all packets, regardless of direction.</description>

      <description>It has been almost 3 years since I wrote Branch Office Connections – GRE over IPSec VPN! For those of you who are familiar with Cisco certification, that means time to renew! Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m coming back now and looking at this lab, I noticed that we are preferring the serial link for traffic! In this day and age, the serial link would likely be the fallback, and a faster, cheaper GRE/IPSEC VPN would likely be the preferable route!</description>
