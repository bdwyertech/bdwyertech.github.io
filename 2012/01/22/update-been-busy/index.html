        <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last posted to this blog, so I figured I would post an update.  I have been very busy lately working to complete my internship requirements to graduate from college while also studying for the MCITP Enterprise Administrator exam.  I should have the latter done in a week or two and will begin studying for the CCNP Route exam.</p>
<p>I have added some new equipment to the lab, including a Dell 4220 42u server rack, Cisco 2821, and another 16gb RAM to my server bringing it to 32gb.</p>
<p>The rack was an absolute necessity.  All of my gear was more or less scattered around not plugged in; I needed a way to efficiently store and power it.  I found the rack locally with the Cisco 2821 and a 10,000 kVa Tripp-Lite 240v SmartOnline UPS for $400.  I could not pass that up.  The rack itself was in great shape, it just had a lot of sheet rock dust on it and needed to be washed.  After washing it with a garden hose, sponge and car soap in my driveway, it cleaned up real nice and was ready to hold my gear.  I grabbed up two power strips from Monoprice with integrated cable management and mounted them neatly in the rear of the rack where the expensive PDU&rsquo;s would normally go.</p>
<p>The Cisco 2821 still had a config on it when I got it so I confreg 0x2142&rsquo;ed it and wiped her clean to confirm she worked.  After doing that, I opened it up, blew a lot of dust out of it and dropped an extra 512mb RAM into it.  While doing so, I saw that it had an AIM-VPN module installed in it leading me to believe that it shipped as a 2821 w/sec package.  Sweet deal!  This thing will likely play a nice role when it comes time to mess with VoIP since it is now my only Cisco piece with that capability.</p>
<p>The server RAM I found on eBay.  Four 4Gb DDR2 FB-DIMM&rsquo;s for $150.  That was another deal I found hard to pass on, especially being that my main usage of the server is for virtualization and labs.  RAM is probably the most critical component of a virtual server for a home lab.  Anyone who has ever run Exchange in a lab or production environment knows just how demanding it can be, especially of RAM.  After stress testing the server, I concluded the RAM is good, so it was definitely a good deal.</p>
